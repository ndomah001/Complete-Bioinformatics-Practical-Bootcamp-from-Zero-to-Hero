[Access to Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-bioinformatics-practical-bootcamp-from-zero-to-hero/)

Embark on a journey into the world of bioinformatics with our **Complete Bioinformatics Practical Bootcamp from Zero to Hero**! This comprehensive training bootcamp is designed for **students**, **academia**, and **industry professionals** looking to extend their understanding of biological data and **excel in the field of bioinformatics**.

Explore the bioinformatics world through **hands-on**, **practical demonstrations** that bridge theory with real-world applications. Learn to navigate biological databases, align sequences, and analyze genomics data using cutting-edge tools and techniques. Dive into **proteomics**, **structural bioinformatics**, and **evolutionary analysis** to uncover the hidden secrets of life's building blocks.

Our course is designed to equip you with the fundamental skills needed for becoming a excellent computational data analyst. You'll delve into ten key modules:

1. Introduction to Bioinformatics
2. Biological Databases
3. Biological Sequence Alignment
4. Genomics Bioinformatics
5. Evolutionary Bioinformatics
6. Proteomics Bioinformatics
7. Structural Bioinformatics
8. Command Line for Bioinformatics
9. Transcriptomics Bioinformatics
10. Final Project

This unique blend of theory and practical application will empower you to handle biological data with confidence. **With 103 lectures, including practical tutorials, 10 assignments, and 11 quizzes and a final project for making your own bioinformatics pipeline for RNA-Seq data analysis on bash**, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of bioinformatics tools and techniques.

From biological databases to building your own pipeline for data analysis, you'll explore a variety of tools that are freely available and closely related to the course material. Some tools may require sign-up, but most will be accessible without any registration. 

By the end of this course, you'll see biological data in a whole new light. We believe this investment in your education will be both valuable and rewarding. Don't miss out on this opportunity to transform your bioinformatics skills.

**What youâ€™ll learn**
- Basic Theory & Practical demonstration of Bioinformatics techniques on both command line and graphical user interface
- How to explore biological databases and retrieve data using databases and their tools
- How to align biological sequences using pairwise and multiple alignment method on both graphical user interface and command line interface
- How to perform genomics analysis like prediction of genes, genome annotation, Intron and exon analysis, gene location and gene enrichment using bioinforma
- How to perform evolutionary bioinformatics analysis also called phylogenetic analysis on both command line and graphical user interface
- How to perform proteomics bioinformatics analysis like motifs and domain finding, protein physical parameters, protein-protein interaction, protein enrichment
- Structural bioinformatics where you will learn homology modeling on GUI and CLI platforms also you will be able to predict 3D structure of proteins
- How to use command line in bioinformatics how to linux subsystem in windows learn some basic use of bash, perform database searching analysis using NCBI E
- How to use transcriptomics data and for NGS and variant calling analysis
- Build your very own pipeline for RNA-Seq and variant calling analysis by using Linux
